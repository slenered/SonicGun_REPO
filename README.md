# Introducing: The Sonic Gun!
***
**A handheld device that creates sound elsewhere!**
**Point and Shoot! It's that easy!**
## Green on the Energy!*
**It won't waste your precious energy!**\
**It comes with an auto recharging battery that gives you 3 simultaneous uses.**
## It's quiet!*
**It's as quiet as a pet rock, as long as you don't point it at yourself**
## Overclock Ready!
**By holding the trigger down you will charge the device to fire repeated sonic blasts!**\
**Warning:** Holding the trigger down for too long will overload the device.\
An overloaded device may:
* Emit a hypersonic blast.
* Cause deafness.

*As long as you don't overload the device

Caution: Sound emitted is highly pitched and may shatter glass or porcelain objects, such as garden gnomes.
